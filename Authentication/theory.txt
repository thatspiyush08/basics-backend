Hashing: its a one way process you take the message hash it and leave you dont need 
decript and save again
hence it is does not required password as you dont need to see the the original response

2)
Encription: Unlike hasing its 2 way include decript and Encription
hence require the password one who write the passpord can only access the original response.


3)
Json Web Token(JWT)
It takes Json as an input and return a token
convert the json into the very long string
more or less a digital signature
